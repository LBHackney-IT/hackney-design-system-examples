# Express.js example

A simple static website using [Express](http://expressjs.com) to serve a HTML webpage, with [Sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass) and [Nunjucks](https://github.com/mozilla/nunjucks) support.

It includes a script to automatically copy assets to the public folder on startup.

This example doesn't include a bundler for client-side JavaScript. You could adapt the [Parcel](https://github.com/LBHackney-IT/hackney-design-system-examples/blob/main/parcel) example to add this.

## Installation

You need Node.js and npm installed.

```
npm install
npm start
```

It will be on `localhost:3000`
